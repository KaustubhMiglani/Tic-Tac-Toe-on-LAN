For Q1 :-
use command g++ client.cpp to compile client 
and use command g++ -pthread Server.cpp -o server.out to create executable server.out 
For the executable of client give the IP address of server as second parameter when executing
log.txt is the log file (It flushes only when the server terminates. So make sure to do that)

For Q2 :-
Use g++ ping.cpp to compile ping.cpp and then sudo ./a.out followed by IP address to run the executable ./a.out formed by ping.cpp
